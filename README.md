# PyTerMusic

A simple terminal music player making use of the ```pygame```, ```mutagen```, and ```curses``` libraries.

Currently supports scanning through all subdirectories for mp3 files, automatically playing the next song in the list, adding and removing songs from the queue, and notifications when a new song plays.
